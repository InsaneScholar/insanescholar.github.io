Here, you will find millions of wonders and facts about different games that you never knew! For example, did you know that <span style="color: green;">creepers</span> are afraid of <span style="color: yellow;">ocelots</span>? Or perhaps that around <span style="color: orange;">Halloween</span> of 2018, you could dance in front of five gargoyle statues in the last mission for getting an emote in <span style="color: purple;">Fortnite</span>? Maybe you didn't know that you can actually find the ghost of Mount Cordo in <span style="color: blue;">GTA 5</span> either! Anyhow, you will gain access to these interesting facts in this library. So delve in right now!</h3>
